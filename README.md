## Motivation

**:chart_with_downwards_trend: The risk involved with accepting volatile currencies**

Dexpay POS, unlike other payment gateways, provides the ability to receive crypto payments with 0-volatility risk in a completely decentralized manner.

By doing so it decreases the merchant risk associated with accepting volatile cryptocurrencies for commerce.
 
The problem is important for merchants because their current value reference system is based on the exchange rate of such currencies versus dollar. Therefore, by enabling those parties to always receive a stable coin (DAI) regardless of the currency used for payment, the volatility risk connected to holding such currencies get close to zero.

Furthermore, merchants may benefit from reduced fees when compared to the current digital payments offered, that would directly translate to higher margins for their business.

**:no_good: Centralized payment gateways**

All cryptocurrency payment gateways today leverage on a centralized architecture to keep track of Ether and other ERC20 token payments like DAI. On the other end, DexPOS leverages on an innovative payment gateway solely operated by smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain: this new approach removes the central point of failure of existing gateways, while delivering a truly permissionless and decentralized solution to accept payment in Ether and ERC20 token.

The implications are extremely important: our payment gateway cannot be stopped. No external company will have the chance to reject or censor any transaction.

**:earth_africa: Equal access to economic opportunities for everyone** 

Being an open platform, Dexpay POS enables economic opportunities through equal access to a high-quality POS system for everyone.
